  <p class="bottom"><i>My Poems Are My Children</i></p>

  <p class="bottom">Why the fuck 
  am I so tired I 
  never do anything. 
  What does it 
  feel like to 
  have ambition 
  beyond the ambition to 
  be held. I think I’d 
  be happier if no 
  one else was 
  doing anything 
  but who knows. 
  I hate working hard 
  just the thought of it 
  makes me sick. 
  My apathy astounds and 
  my privilege enlightens. 
  Just a boy with 
  too much money and 
  not enough time or 
  vice versa or 
  too much of both 
  or neither. 
  Nothing left to 
  attain, nothing I 
  don’t already have 
  save for children, but 
  my poems are my children 
  and all the children 
  in the street are 
  my children. I 
  make faces and they 
  run back to 
  their parents.</p>
