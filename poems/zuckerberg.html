  <p class = "bottom"><i>Poor Zuckerberg</i></p>

  <p class = "bottom">Wake up at 4 
  thinking about Facebook 
  and I want to kill myself. 
  Turn towards the window 
  and think about jumping. 
  That would shut everybody the fuck up.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">Nobody likes me and 
  I don’t give a fuck. 
  Kind of cared when 
  they made Social Network 
  but now I just think it’s funny. 
  Everybody has such a short 
  attention span. Remember 
  Cambridge Analytica? 
  Something new to talk about 
  on the app I fucking invented. 
  Like mice on coke 
  running around the maze 
  yelling about how 
  shitty the coke is.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">Everyone’s so stupid this 
  app’s so dumb. At least 
  Congress is talking about this shit 
  instead of another Iraq. 
  More people 
  would kill themselves 
  if Facebook didn’t exist, 
  probably. 
  Kids always find a way 
  to get bullied or depressed. 
  I just monetized it.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">Check my phone. 
  No texts, no one 
  texts me anymore, 
  everyone thinks I’m too busy, 
  which is fine. I don’t really 
  want to talk to anyone. 
  Spend all my time 
  thinking about how 
  everyone talks to 
  everyone else 
  simultaneously and 
  instantaneously. 
  How am I supposed to find 
  any one conversation 
  interesting? 
  It’s like those guys 
  who watch so much porn 
  they can’t come from sex, 
  speaking of which, 
  I haven’t come in months. 
  Sex is boring 
  and I can’t focus 
  long enough to masturbate. 
  So many things more interesting 
  than coming. So many things more 
  interesting than people.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">Sometimes wake up 
  feeling so shitty 
  I slouch over to Priscilla’s room 
  and crawl into her bed 
  and nuzzle her, except she’s 
  so cold. I kiss her neck 
  while she fingers herself. 
  I’ll never learn anything new. 
  I’m smarter than everyone 
  and the algorithms are smarter 
  than me, but sure, 
  I’ll fix them so there’s 
  less hate speech. 
  Fine. Whatever. Anything else? 
  Perhaps an algorithm 
  to make your wife come?</p>
