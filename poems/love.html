  <p class="bottom"><i>A Poem To Wake Up To</i></p>

  <p class="bottom">
    Okay, a poem to wake up to.<br>
    First, this poem is about you,<br>
    as is every poem<br>
    I write and every poem<br>
    I read and everything beautiful<br> 
    always. Second, I have no interest in<br> 
    hurting you, I know because<br>
    I am smart and I have hurt people<br> 
    on purpose before and itâ€™s never<br>
    made them love me. I am a<br> 
    fast learner and I<br>
    rarely make the same<br>
    mistake twice. I have no interest in<br> 
    reliving the past, I am not<br> 
    moved by it. It is not beautiful<br>
    to me, and even if it was,<br> 
    I have only ever seen everything<br> 
    beautiful as everything I stand to lose.<br> 
    I do no covet memory,<br>
    it is not perfect or permanent<br>
    enough to live in, whereas<br> 
    the future is a home<br>
    full of books and pictures<br> 
    of the person I love as a child.
