  <p class="bottom"><i>A Poem To Wake Up To</i></p>

  <p class="bottom">
    Okay, a poem to wake up to. 
    First, this poem is about you, 
    as is every poem 
    I write and every poem 
    I read and everything beautiful  
    always. Second, I have no interest in  
    hurting you, I know because 
    I am smart and I have hurt people  
    on purpose before and itâ€™s never 
    made them love me. I am a  
    fast learner and I 
    rarely make the same 
    mistake twice. I have no interest in  
    reliving the past, I am not  
    moved by it. It is not beautiful 
    to me, and even if it was,  
    I have only ever seen everything  
    beautiful as everything I stand to lose.  
    I do no covet memory, 
    it is not perfect or permanent 
    enough to live in, whereas  
    the future is a home 
    full of books and pictures  
    of the person I love as a child.
