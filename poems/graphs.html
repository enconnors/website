  <p class = "bottom"><i>My Graphs Made the News</i></p>

  <p class = "bottom">1.<br>
  My graphs made<br>
  the news.<br>
  Girlfriend’s excited<br>
  but people’s graphs make<br>
  the news <br>
  all the time, and besides,<br>
  I think my graphs<br>
  might be wrong.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">2. <br>
  Shouldn’t have told<br>
  anyone my graphs<br>
  made the news I’m <br>
  really not excited about <br>
  it. Girlfriend says<br>
  I should put them on <br>
  my resume but where <br>
  would they even go?<br>
  Leadership?</p>

  <p class = "bottom">3. <br>
  My boss tells me I’m in<br>
  line for a pay raise and I <br>
  can’t help but wonder<br>
  if it’s because my <br>
  graphs made the news.<br>
  But I don’t make<br>
  graphs for the<br>
  money or the<br>
  fame I make<br>
  graphs because<br>
  I’m a masochist.<br>
  If I were my boss<br>
  I would’ve said,<br>
  “You want a pay raise?<br>
  People make graphs<br>
  <i>better</i> than you. <br>
  People make graphs<br>
  <i>faster</i> than you.<br>
  Your dad has a <i>bigger dick</i><br>
  than you.<br>
  Graph that,<br>
  bitch.”</p>

  <p class = "bottom">4. <br>
  Can’t find my <br>
  poetry notebook and <br>
  I’m worried because<br>
  some of my most<br>
  valuable poems<br>
  are in there.<br>
  I was just telling<br>
  my friend<br>
  I don’t know<br>
  if my poems <br>
  are any good but<br>
  they’re sure worth a lot <br>
  of money. <br>
  He wanted to buy this <br>
  poem on the spot<br>
  but I gave it<br>
  to charity.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">5. <br>
  You would<br>
  tell me if <br>
  something I <br>
  said was <br>
  a poem, right?<br>
  I ask my girlfriend. <br>
  I’m as paranoid<br>
  about losing<br>
  a poem as I am <br>
  about losing my <br>
  poetry notebook.<br>
  This thing has <br>
  some of my <br>
  most valuable poems<br>
  in it. Really need to<br>
  scan them.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">6.<br>
  I told my girlfriend<br>
  I wish<br>
  I could give you <br>
  half the poems<br>
  that plague me in <br>
  such abundance and<br>
  she got offended and<br>
  asked if I <br>
  thought she had no <br>
  talent of her own.<br>
  And I was like what?<br>
  My poem net <br>
  worth is 2 million dollars.<br>
  If I gave you<br>
  half my poems<br>
  you’d be worth 1 million<br>
  dollars. That’s almost <br>
  as much as<br>
  your mom<br>
  makes in a year.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">7.<br>
  I said something and<br>
  my girlfriend was like<br>
  That’s a poem. <br>
  And I was like no,<br>
  that was a skit.<br>
  If skits were<br>
  poems, John <br>
  Belushi would<br>
  be our Nobel <br>
  Laureate and <br>
  Louise Gluck <br>
  would be our<br>
  president.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">8.<br>
  I google <br>
  “Louise Gluck graphs”<br>
  but she has<br>
  only poems<br>
  in the news.<br>
  Sucker.</p>
