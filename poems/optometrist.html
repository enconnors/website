  <p class = "bottom">1.<br>
  If I was<br>
  an optometrist<br>
  I would let<br>
  the patients<br>
  pick the <br>
  music so they’d <br>
  be happy and<br>
  I’d hear <br>
  new music. <br>
  Then I’d go <br>
  home and<br>
  get drunk on <br>
  craft beer and<br>
  look at Polaroids of <br>
  my ex-wife naked and<br>
  think about killing <br>
  myself until I fell<br>
  asleep.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">2. <br>
  I hope the <br>
  vision lady likes<br>
  my eyes I hope<br>
  she compliments them<br>
  I hope I’m <br>
  taller than her<br>
  husband and<br>
  the waiting room has<br>
  People and I hope<br>
  there’s no wait and <br>
  the receptionist acts<br>
  like she knows me and<br>
  guess what?<br>
  I’m taller than <br>
  her husband too.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">3. <br>
  My vision lady was a <br>
  vision boy today and<br>
  kind of strange and<br>
  awkward, like a <br>
  vision intern. <br>
  The screen<br>
  where they show<br>
  you letters <br>
  broke and I said <br>
  The classic eye charts are <br>
  laughing in their <br>
  graves and he said<br>
  I know<br>
  This is what we get for our hubris.<br>
  Then he showed me <br>
  pictures and asked <br>
  Better or worse<br>
  Better or worse<br>
  Better or worse and <br>
  almost everything was<br>
  better and I always<br>
  knew right away and <br>
  I expected him to say <br>
  You’re the most <br>
  decisive patient we’ve<br>
  ever had <br>
  You know exactly <br>
  what you want <br>
  but he just <br>
  dilated my eyes and <br>
  left me<br>
  in the waiting room.<br>
  Walls full<br>
  of nice glasses.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">4. <br>
  Get this<br>
  My friend from high school gets in a <br>
  bad car accident.<br>
  Loses sight in his left eye.<br>
  I say to everyone that<br>
  will listen: <br>
  Life is precious.<br>
  Sight is precious.<br>
  That night I take an edible and <br>
  marvel at the eye. I say <br>
  I think how the<br>
  eye works is it’s a <br>
  set of mirrors<br>
  like a periscope.<br>
  My friend from college says no,<br>
  it’s photoreceptors.<br>
  I ask him if it’s <br>
  true that everyone <br>
  sees different colors and<br>
  he says no, <br>
  that’s impossible.<br>
  The next morning<br>
  I go to the <br>
  eye doctor and<br>
  I’m so busy<br>
  writing poems <br>
  I forget everything<br>
  I learned the day before.<br>
  They charge me $114 and<br>
  I’m like what?<br>
  This sucks.<br>
  I’m never going to the optometrist again.</p>
