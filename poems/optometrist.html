  If I was 
  an optometrist 
  I would let 
  the patients 
  pick the 
  music so they’d 
  be happy and 
  I’d hear 
  new music. 
  Then I’d go 
  home and 
  get drunk on 
  craft beer and 
  look at Polaroids of 
  my ex-wife naked and 
  think about killing 
  myself until I fell 
  asleep.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">2. 
  I hope the 
  vision lady likes 
  my eyes I hope 
  she compliments them 
  I hope I’m 
  taller than her 
  husband and 
  the waiting room has 
  People and I hope 
  there’s no wait and 
  the receptionist acts 
  like she knows me and 
  guess what? 
  I’m taller than 
  her husband too.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">3. 
  My vision lady was a 
  vision boy today and 
  kind of strange and 
  awkward, like a 
  vision intern. 
  The screen 
  where they show 
  you letters 
  broke and I said 
  the classic eye charts are 
  laughing in their 
  graves and he said 
  I know 
  this is what we get for our hubris. 
  Then he showed me 
  pictures and asked 
  better or worse 
  better or worse 
  better or worse and 
  almost everything was 
  better and I always 
  knew right away and 
  I expected him to say 
  you’re the most 
  decisive patient we’ve 
  ever had 
  you know exactly 
  what you want 
  but he just 
  dilated my eyes and 
  left me 
  in the waiting room. 
  Walls full 
  of nice glasses.</p>

  <p class = "bottom">4. 
  Get this
  my friend from high school gets in a 
  bad car accident. 
  Loses sight in his left eye. 
  I say to everyone that 
  will listen: 
  Life is precious. 
  Sight is precious. 
  That night I take an edible and 
  marvel at the eye. I say 
  I think how the 
  eye works is it’s a 
  set of mirrors 
  like a periscope. 
  My friend from college says no, 
  it’s photoreceptors. 
  I ask him if it’s 
  true that everyone 
  sees different colors and 
  he says no, 
  that’s impossible. 
  The next morning 
  I go to the 
  eye doctor and 
  I’m so busy 
  writing poems 
  I forget everything 
  I learned the day before. 
  They charge me $114 and 
  I’m like what? 
  This sucks. 
  I’m never going to the optometrist again.</p>
