  <p class = "poetry"><i>My Graphs Made the News</i></p>

  <p class = "poetry">1.</br>
  My graphs made  
  the news.  
  Girlfriend’s excited  
  but people’s graphs make  
  the news  
  all the time, and besides,  
  I think my graphs  
  might be wrong.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">2.</br> 
  Shouldn’t have told  
  anyone my graphs  
  made the news I’m  
  really not excited about  
  it. Girlfriend says  
  I should put them on  
  my resume but where  
  would they even go?  
  Leadership?</p>

  <p class = "poetry">3.</br>  
  My boss tells me I’m in  
  line for a pay raise and I  
  can’t help but wonder  
  if it’s because my  
  graphs made the news.  
  But I don’t make  
  graphs for the  
  money or the  
  fame I make  
  graphs because  
  I’m a masochist.  
  If I were my boss  
  I would’ve said,  
  “You want a pay raise?  
  People make graphs  
  <i>better</i> than you.  
  People make graphs  
  <i>faster</i> than you.  
  Your dad has a <i>bigger dick</i>
  than you.  
  Graph that,  
  bitch.”</p>

  <p class = "poetry">4.</br>  
  Can’t find my  
  poetry notebook and  
  I’m worried because  
  some of my most  
  valuable poems  
  are in there.  
  I was just telling  
  my friend  
  I don’t know  
  if my poems  
  are any good but  
  they’re sure worth a lot  
  of money.  
  He wanted to buy this  
  poem on the spot  
  but I gave it  
  to charity.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">5.</br>  
  You would  
  tell me if  
  something I  
  said was  
  a poem, right?  
  I ask my girlfriend.  
  I’m as paranoid  
  about losing  
  a poem as I am  
  about losing my  
  poetry notebook.  
  This thing has  
  some of my  
  most valuable poems  
  in it. Really need to  
  scan them.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">6.</br>  
  I told my girlfriend  
  I wish  
  I could give you  
  half the poems  
  that plague me in  
  such abundance and  
  she got offended and  
  asked if I  
  thought she had no  
  talent of her own.  
  And I was like what?  
  My poem net  
  worth is 2 million dollars.  
  If I gave you  
  half my poems  
  you’d be worth 1 million  
  dollars. That’s almost  
  as much as  
  your mom  
  makes in a year.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">7.</br>  
  I said something and  
  my girlfriend was like  
  That’s a poem.  
  And I was like no,  
  that was a skit.  
  If skits were  
  poems, John  
  Belushi would  
  be our Nobel  
  Laureate and  
  Louise Gluck  
  would be our  
  president.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">8.</br>  
  I google  
  “Louise Gluck graphs”  
  but she has  
  only poems  
  in the news.  
  Sucker.</p>
