  <p class="poetry"><i>A Poem To Wake Up To</i></p>

  <p class="poetry">
    Okay, a poem to wake up to.<br/> 
    First, this poem is about you,<br/> 
    as is every poem<br/> 
    I write and every poem<br/> 
    I read and everything beautiful<br/>  
    always. Second, I have no interest in<br/>  
    hurting you, I know because<br/> 
    I am smart and I have hurt people<br/>  
    on purpose before and itâ€™s never<br/> 
    made them love me. I am a<br/>  
    fast learner and I<br/> 
    rarely make the same<br/> 
    mistake twice. I have no interest in<br/>  
    reliving the past, I am not<br/>  
    moved by it. It is not beautiful<br/> 
    to me, and even if it was,<br/>  
    I have only ever seen everything<br/>  
    beautiful as everything I stand to lose.<br/>  
    I do no covet memory,<br/> 
    it is not perfect or permanent<br/> 
    enough to live in, whereas<br/>  
    the future is a home<br/> 
    full of books and pictures<br/>  
    of the person I love as a child.
