  <p class = "poetry"><i>Poor Zuckerberg</i></p>

  <p class = "poetry">Wake up at 4<br/>
  thinking about Facebook<br/> 
  and I want to kill myself.<br/> 
  Turn towards the window<br/> 
  and think about jumping.<br/> 
  That would shut everybody the fuck up.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">Nobody likes me and<br/> 
  I don’t give a fuck.<br/> 
  Kind of cared when<br/> 
  they made Social Network<br/> 
  but now I just think it’s funny.<br/> 
  Everybody has such a short<br/> 
  attention span. Remember<br/>
  Cambridge Analytica?<br/> 
  Something new to talk about<br/> 
  on the app I fucking invented.<br/> 
  Like mice on coke<br/> 
  running around the maze<br/> 
  yelling about how<br/> 
  shitty the coke is.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">Everyone’s so stupid this<br/> 
  app’s so dumb. At least<br/> 
  Congress is talking about this shit<br/> 
  instead of another Iraq.<br/> 
  More people<br/> 
  would kill themselves<br/> 
  if Facebook didn’t exist,<br/> 
  probably.<br/> 
  Kids always find a way<br/> 
  to get bullied or depressed.<br/> 
  I just monetized it.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">Check my phone.<br/> 
  No texts, no one<br/> 
  texts me anymore,<br/> 
  everyone thinks I’m too busy,<br/> 
  which is fine. I don’t really<br/> 
  want to talk to anyone.<br/> 
  Spend all my time<br/> 
  thinking about how<br/> 
  everyone talks to<br/> 
  everyone else<br/> 
  simultaneously and<br/> 
  instantaneously.<br/> 
  How am I supposed to find<br/> 
  any one conversation<br/> 
  interesting?<br/> 
  It’s like those guys<br/> 
  who watch so much porn<br/> 
  they can’t come from sex,<br/>
  speaking of which,<br/> 
  I haven’t come in months.<br/> 
  Sex is boring<br/> 
  and I can’t focus<br/> 
  long enough to masturbate.<br/> 
  So many things more interesting<br/> 
  than coming. So many things more<br/> 
  interesting than people.</p>

  <p class = "poetry">Sometimes wake up<br/> 
  feeling so shitty<br/> 
  I slouch over to Priscilla’s room<br/> 
  and crawl into her bed<br/> 
  and nuzzle her, except she’s<br/> 
  so cold. I kiss her neck<br/> 
  while she fingers herself.<br/> 
  I’ll never learn anything new.<br/> 
  I’m smarter than everyone<br/> 
  and the algorithms are smarter<br/> 
  than me, but sure,<br/> 
  I’ll fix them so there’s<br/> 
  less hate speech.<br/> 
  Fine. Whatever. Anything else?<br/> 
  Perhaps an algorithm<br/> 
  to make your wife come?</p>
