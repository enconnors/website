  <u>Elliot Connors</u> is a formerly depressed writer from the American Rust Belt, 
  a formerly depressed region that, much like Elliot, has enjoyed something 
  of a renaissance in recent years. Elliot enjoys writing about people’s mental 
  health struggles, in the hopes that he might monetize these people’s suffering 
  and become a messianic figure to depressed people around the globe.</br></br>

  Elliot's prose has been honored or featured in the <i>Best American Essays of 2021</i>, 
  the <i><a href = "https://theadroitjournal.org/issue-thirty-four/elliot-connors-prose/" target = "blank_">
  Adroit Journal</a></i>, the <i>Yale Literary Magazine</i>, 
  <i><a href = "https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-13-raddest-things-about-turning-13" target = "blank_">
  McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</a></i>, and the <i>Yale Record</i>, 
  the world’s oldest humor publication, of which he was 
  Editor in Chief. At Yale, he studied under Susan Choi, Anne Fadiman, and 
  Mark Oppenheimer.</br></br> 
  
  In 2019, he received a Richter Fellowship to live in 
  rural Québec and research the curse a priest put on his family that caused 
  5 of his relatives to commit suicide. He is currently working on a memoir about 
  that experience, as well as developing several television pilots and assisting 
  an acclaimed screenwriter with his wide-ranging portfolio.</br></br> 
  
  Beyond writing, Elliot works as a Senior Data Analyst for the homepage of the <i>New York Times</i>, 
  and previously conducted research on decarceration for the Vera Institute of Justice.</br></br>
