    I am fifteen and my father is teaching me how to drive. His lap is uncomfortable, but unfortunately, our car does not have built-in seat warmers. It is these small sacrifices that remind me of the way in which my father loves, the blood pulsing through his hot thighs like two beating hearts.

    But my grandmother was more than just a statistic. She was also one of the six million American adults living with Alzheimer’s. It’s difficult to watch someone you love suffer from Alzheimer’s, because you can never tell if they’re just faking it for attention. This is why you need to constantly test their memory. If they sometimes remember things and sometimes don’t, they’re probably faking and you should call the Alzheimer’s Association to come and arrest them. The Alzheimer’s Association jail is like a regular jail except they’re always making you run 5K’s to raise money for the jail, and then when you can’t run anymore, they shoot you dead like a horse.

    I think my grandmother really had Alzheimer’s, though, because she kept her story straight those last seven years. Whenever we visited, she seemed to sort of remember our faces but never our names. Her memory essentially rewinded, so that by the end, she thought she was a kid again. She often asked when her father was going to pick her up and take her home, which was sad, because her father was really, really dead. I kept trying to tell her this, but she never believed me. She thought it was one of my classic bits. And can you blame her? I was comedy’s favorite bad boy; but at what cost?

    Maybe it’s because I’m really smart, but I’ve never believed in any of the “classic” conspiracy theories. I don’t believe in the “Illuminati” or the “New World Order.” I don’t believe JFK’s assassination was meant to be a “harmless prank.” I don’t believe Amelia Earhart just took a little bit longer than people expected to circumnavigate the globe and then when she finally tried to land she accidentally hit the first tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 1972. I don’t believe that the government covered the crash up by building a second tower to hide the spot where she hit the first one. I don’t believe that when they realized they had to make it seem like it was the plan all along to build two towers, some dumbass was like “Let’s just call them ‘The Twin Towers’!” I don’t believe Earhart crashed because she was fighting with her navigator over whether she deserved another pair of Kids’ Wings for what was “basically a done deal of a landing.” I don’t believe George W. Bush planned 9/11 as a way to announce his new national holiday, Welcome Back Amelia Day!, a day celebrating “women’s best efforts in STEM,” but then blamed it on Al Qaeda when everybody got mad. I don’t believe he also sent a plane to hit the Pentagon because he thought it should only have four walls “like every other damn building.”

  <!-- Childrearing -->

  <p class = "garamond_body"> 
    And so I find myself outside a two-story colonial in the suburbs of Chicago, hand delivering my final invitation to a promising young child wrestler who caught my eye at the tournament because he was much bigger than the other wrestlers and kept blowing a whistle. Standing here, I am reminded of the blissful childhood I missed out on because of my parents’ clinical depression, which I have unfortunately inherited, and realize that the mission of my academy goes so far beyond teaching children to wrestle. Our mission is to cure depression. Yes, it’s ambitious, and no, I don’t think it will be easy. But who ever said running the world’s first ever children’s wrestling academy for the cure for charity for profit was going to be easy? And of course, we couldn’t do it without our generous sponsors. Amazon, we love you baby. You’re doing the lord’s work.

  <p class = "garamond_body"> 
    I’ve wanted to go to space ever since the third grade, when I first saw “Toy Story.” I was horrified by the limp impotence of Buzz Lightyear, a tiny little baby astronaut who could barely fly across a child’s bedroom, let alone venture into the boundless expanse of space. What a stupid little baby. I realized that if I ever failed so horrendously in terms of astronauting, I would never gain the respect of the brave cowboys whom I admired. I resolved to be the best astronaut this universe had ever seen, even better than Neil Armstrong, who spent his entire life chasing a moon he wasn’t even sure existed. If that isn’t astronauting, then I am deeply confused as to the definition of astronauting.
