    Elliot Connors is a formerly depressed writer from the American Rust Belt, 
    a formerly depressed region that, much like Elliot, has enjoyed something 
    of a renaissance in recent years.</br></br> 
    Elliot enjoys writing about people’s mental 
    health struggles, in the hopes that he might monetize these people’s suffering 
    and become a messianic figure to depressed people around the globe.</br></br>  
    His <a href = "internet.html">comedy</a> has been published in <i>McSweeney’s</i> 
    and the <i>Yale Record</i>, the world’s oldest humor 
    magazine, of which he was Editor in Chief from 2018 to 2019.</br></br>  
    His <a href = "television.html">stage and screenwriting</a> 
    have won various minor awards, and he regularly performs sketch and 
    improv around New York City.</br></br>
    In addition to comedy, Elliot is an accomplished <a href = "prose.html">essayist</a>, 
    whose work has been honored or featured in <i>The Best American Essays of 2021</i>, 
    <i>The Adroit Journal</i>, and the <i>Yale Literary Magazine</i>. He is currently working 
    on a memoir about the curse a priest put on his family in rural Québec, 
    which caused 5 of his relatives to commit suicide.</br></br>
