  <p class = "bottom"><i>An overexcited improv group rushes on stage, clapping and hooting.</i></p>

  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISERS: <i>(all doing an exaggerated wave in unison)</i> Helllooooo!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: And welcome to Freeplay, a night of improv comedy. Tonight, all the scenes you’re going to see will be 100% improvised. But to get things started, we’re going to need a one-word suggestion from you guys, the audience, so feel free to shout out your ideas!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Awkward silence.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 2: Don’t be shy! It can be the first word that comes to your mind.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Awkward silence. After a pause, a man wearing a black turtleneck raises hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Yes, you sir! And just for future reference, you don’t have to raise your hand. Let’s hear it!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: Stallion.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Improvisers act as if they're mulling the suggestion over.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Hm, okay, I like that. But why don't we try to just get a couple more suggestions? Let’s hear them guys!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Another silence. Man again raises hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Great! And again, sir, no need to raise your hand! Feel free to just shout it out.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: How about stallion?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Yep, we got that one. I think we’ll try a slightly more specific prompt, just to make sure everyone’s getting involved. Can we get a relationship that two people can have?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Awkward silence. Again, after a pause, the man raises his hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Yes, you again! And put that darned hand down!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: Two stallions who are brothers.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Actually, sir, we’re going to need a relationship that two people can have, not animals. So if anyone else has any ideas...</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>The man raises his hand again.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Yes?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: A brother and a sister who are dressed up as two stallions who are brothers.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Ah, unfortunately we don’t have any costumes.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: Would you like to borrow mine?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: <i>(Increasingly frustrated)</i> Ok, you know what, let’s just start fresh. And remember guys, it’s really important that everyone shouts out suggestions so we can have a great show. Let’s get some ideas for a non-geographical location!</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Awkward silence. A woman raises her hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: <i>(To other improvisers)</i> Yes! Fantastic! You in the back.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">WOMAN: Uh, Nebraska?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Ok, so that’s actually a geographical location. Can we please, please get a non-geographical location?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>No one raises their hand again. Silence. Man raises his hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Ah fuck.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 2: <i>(To improviser 1)</i> If you don’t call on him he won’t-</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: A stallion’s living chambers.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Do you mean like a stable?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: <i>(A pause, contemplating)</i> No.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Ok you know what, from this half of the audience <i>(gestures to half where man is not seated)</i> could we please just get a suggestion for an emotion that someone might experience? Any emotion.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Awkward silence. Man gets up and forces person in correct half of the audience to switch seats with him. Man sits down and then after getting settled in, raises his hand.</i></p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Alright, let me guess: you want to see a scene about whatever emotion stallions experience. Right?</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: I was actually going to say joy.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: Oh. Well that’s perfect-</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: <i>(Slow, methodical)</i> The joy of a stallion prancing amidst buckwheat, his lustrous hide glistening in the resplendent Nebraskan sun. But this stallion has a secret: he’s a killer. Lying dead in the field is a golden mare who repeatedly spurned his advances. Enter Herman and McCloskey, the two most cunning stallion detectives Norfolk’s ever seen. <i>(He gets onto the improv stage.)</i> I imagine you <i>(starts to guide one of the improvisers into place)</i> as Herman, and you as McCloskey, no, <i>(changes his mind, picks new improviser)</i> you as McCloskey. <i>(Points to original pick.)</i> You can be a tendril of buckwheat. Herman you say “Note the contusions around her vertebrae.” Say it.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 1: <i>(Scared)</i> Note the contusions around her vertebrae.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: Good. Now Herman, you say “Looks like someone knew how to beat a dead horse.”</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">IMPROVISER 2: <i>(Scared)</i> Looks like someone knew how to beat a dead horse.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom">MAN: Nicely done. Ok, now I’m the stallion from the buckwheat. Bam, bam! <i>(He mimes shooting Herman with a gun.)</i> You’re dead, lie down, lie down. <i>(Improviser slowly lies down. He then mimes shooting McCloskey with a gun.)</i> You’re dead now too, lie down. Lie down next to Herman. <i>(He shoots the rest of the improvisers who aren’t in the scene.)</i> All of you are dead. <i>(Pauses. To audience in southern accent.)</i> You know what they say: Norfolk’s always been a one-horse town.</p>
  
  <p class = "bottom"><i>Man bows. Blackout.</i></p>
