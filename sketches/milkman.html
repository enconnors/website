  Know I can dream big, and I have.<br>
  When I was a boy, I looked up at the sky<br>
  and thought I could touch it.<br> 
  But now, I know my time has come. </p>

  <p class = "bottom"><i>Everyone on stage echoes, “Time has come.”</i></p>

  <p class = "bottom">And I know, there is only so much I can offer<br>
  And you know, I have put my whole heart on the line.<br>

  <p class = "bottom">MILKMAN: (Rubato.) After I’ll never look back, good luck with the waaaaar.</p>

  <p class = "bottom"><i>Milkman holds out last note as he turns to hug and then salute Milk President. During hug, Milk President transfers a bag of milk to Milkman, which Milkman conceals against his chest. He then turns back to the crowd and sings last note falsetto. Milk President slits his throat. Milkman collapses and squeezes the bag of milk out onto the stage so that it looks like his neck is spurting milk instead of blood. Then, everyone is still.</i></p>

  <p class = "bottom">YOUNG GIRL: </i>(Walks downstage. Horrified.)</i> So that’s what the 1950’s were like?</p>
